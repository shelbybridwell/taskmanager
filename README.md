<p>AS AN employee with a busy schedule
 I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule 
<br>WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar 
<br>WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours 
<br>WHEN I view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
<br>WHEN I click into a time block THEN I can enter an event 
<br>WHEN I click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage <br>WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist</p>
